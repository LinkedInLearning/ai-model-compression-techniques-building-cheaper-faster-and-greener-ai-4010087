## Course Description

In this course, Tejas Chopra—an advocate for efficient, green computing—explores how to make AI/ML models more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. Dive into practical techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. Learn how to reduce model size and memory usage without significantly compromising accuracy. Use hands-on coding exercises in TensorFlow and PyTorch to implement these techniques and fine-tune models for optimal performance. Build your understanding of how to balance accuracy, efficiency, and sustainability, giving you the tools to build smarter, faster, and greener AI systems. Whether you’re building edge AI applications, deploying models at scale, or seeking to lower carbon footprints, this course equips you with actionable strategies to address real-world challenges in AI.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
